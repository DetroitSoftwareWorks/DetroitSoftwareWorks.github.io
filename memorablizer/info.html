                <p/>The <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) recommends the use of dice to <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords#1">generate passwords</a> that are both secure and easy to remember. This method is time-consuming, but if you need the level of security it provides, it may be your best option.

                <p/>If youâ€™re looking for a more convenient approach, this app is for you.

                <p/>Memorablizer converts random, secure passwords generated by password managers (from an app store or your web browser) to passphrases that are just as random but easier to remember&mdash;more <em>memorable</em>.

                <p/>Note: At the time of publication, the EFF recommended using six words in your passphrase for sensitive applications like your disk encryption and your password manager.
