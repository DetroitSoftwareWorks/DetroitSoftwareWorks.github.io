    <h2>Make Secure Passwords <em>Memorable</em><h2>

    <p>The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org) (EFF) recommends the use of dice to [generate passwords](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords#1) that are both secure and easy to remember. This method is time-consuming, but if you need the level of security it provides, it may be your best option.

    <p>If you’re looking for a more convenient approach, this app is for you.

    <p>Memorablizer converts random, secure passwords generated by password managers (from an app store or your web browser) to passphrases that are just as random but easier to remember—more <em>memorable</em>.

    <p>Note: At the time of publication, the EFF recommended using six words in your passphrase for sensitive applications like your disk encryption and your password manager.
